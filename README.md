## 🚀 Key Features

- 📸 Image Classification (25 classes)
- 🎯 Object Detection with YOLOv8
- 🔄 Hybrid CNN + YOLO inference pipeline
- 📊 Model performance comparison dashboard
- 🎥 Live webcam detection (optional)
- ☁️ Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces

---

## 🧠 Models Used

### 🔹 Classification Models
- MobileNetV2 (Fine-tuned) ✅ **Best performing**
- VGG16
- ResNet50
- EfficientNetB0

### 🔹 Detection Model
- YOLOv8 (custom trained on COCO 25-class subset)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: **COCO Dataset**
- Classes: 25 common objects  
  (`person, car, bicycle, dog, cat, airplane, bus, truck, bottle, chair, ...`)
- Balanced test set used for evaluation

## 📊 Model Performance Summary

| Model            | Accuracy | Inference Time |
|------------------|----------|----------------|
| MobileNetV2      | **59%**  | ~10 sec |
| VGG16            | 34%      | ~4.5 sec |
| ResNet50         | 24%      | ~9 sec |
| EfficientNetB0   | 4%       | ~14 sec |
| YOLOv8 (Detection) | mAP@0.5 ≈ 0.78 | Real-time |

> 📌 MobileNetV2 was selected as the **primary CNN** due to best accuracy–speed tradeoff.
